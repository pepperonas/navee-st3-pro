## Physical Layer

### 5-Wire Dashboard Cable Pinout

| Color  | Function              | Voltage  | Notes                                         |
|--------|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Black  | GND                   | 0V       | Reference ground                              |
| Red    | VCC (Battery)         | 53.04V   | WARNING: Do NOT connect to microcontroller    |
| Blue   | VCC (Dashboard)       | 52.2V    | WARNING: Do NOT connect to microcontroller    |
| Yellow | Signal (unknown)      | 3.76V    | Not UART — unknown signal, do not use         |
| Green  | UART (bidirectional)  | ~4.12V   | Data line — 19200 baud, both directions       |

### UART Parameters

| Parameter   | Value       |
|-------------|-------------|
| Baud Rate   | 19200       |
| Data Bits   | 8           |
| Parity      | None        |
| Stop Bits   | 1           |
| Logic Level | ~4V (non-standard — not 3.3V or 5V) |

The logic level of approximately 4V means direct connection to a 3.3V microcontroller (Arduino, ESP32) requires a logic level shifter. In practice, 5V Arduino inputs have tolerated this signal directly in testing, but a level shifter is recommended for safe long-term use.

## Frame Format

The internal UART protocol uses a different frame structure than the BLE protocol. There is no `0x55 0xAA` header. Instead, it uses complementary header/footer byte pairs.

```
┌──────────┬──────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Header   │ DATA         │ Checksum │ Footer   │
│ 1 Byte   │ n Bytes      │ 1 Byte   │ 1 Byte   │
└──────────┴──────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

### Header / Footer Complement Pairs

Header and Footer are always complements: `Header XOR Footer = 0xFF`.

| Direction              | Header | Footer | Complement Check        |
|------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|
| Dashboard → Controller | `0x61` | `0x9E` | `0x61 + 0x9E = 0xFF` ✅ |
| Controller → Dashboard | `0x64` | `0x9B` | `0x64 + 0x9B = 0xFF` ✅ |

### Checksum Calculation

```
Checksum = SUM(all bytes before checksum position) & 0xFF
```

This includes the header byte through the last data byte. Verified against all three frame types. ✅

ECO,   Light OFF: 61 30 0A 35 00 88 17 15 01 00 00 00 00 85 9E

#### Speed Bytes 6 and 7 — Important Finding

These bytes were initially identified as speed limit control values sent from dashboard to controller. Arduino MitM testing (1000+ frames modified from `0x17`/`0x16` to `0x1E`/`0x1E`, i.e., 30/30 km/h) demonstrated that the controller completely ignores these values. The scooter remained at 22 km/h throughout testing.

**Conclusion:** Bytes 6 and 7 are telemetry or display values, not authoritative speed limit control. See the Speed Limit Architecture section below.

#### Startup Speed — Byte 10

- `0x0A` (10): Rolling start assist speed of 10 km/h
- `0x00` (0): No startup assist

#### Variable Byte 8

Byte 8 was observed to drop to `0x00`/`0x01` when the headlight was switched off (previously `0x02`–`0x04` with light on). Likely candidates: power consumption level, PWM duty cycle, or hall sensor feedback from the motor.

Frame C was observed to remain completely unchanged across mode switches (ECO ↔ SPORT) and headlight toggles. Values in Frame C are likely only updated during active riding.

## Key Finding: Speed Limit Architecture

The UART MitM experiment (Arduino UNO inserted on the green wire) conclusively proved that the speed limit is not modifiable via UART frame manipulation.

### Test Setup

- Arduino Nano inserted between dashboard connector (green wire) and controller
- Frame A bytes 6 and 7 intercepted and rewritten from `0x17`/`0x16` to `0x1E`/`0x1E` (30/30 km/h)
- Checksum recalculated correctly for each modified frame
- Over 1168 frames successfully intercepted, modified, and forwarded
- Serial interface provided live control: `u` = unlock, `p` = passthrough, `+`/`-` for speed adjustment

### Result

The scooter remained at 22 km/h throughout the test. The controller did not respond to the modified values.

### Conclusion

```
Speed Limit Chain (normal operation):
  Dashboard FW (RTL8762C)
    → computes speed limit based on PID / region code
    → sends UART frames to controller
    → controller enforces limit from its own internal state

MitM Attack (tested):
  Dashboard → [Arduino modifies Frame A bytes 6-7] → Controller
    → Controller IGNORES the manipulated speed values
    → Speed remains at 22 km/h
```

The speed limit is enforced inside the controller firmware, not by the UART data stream. The dashboard UART frames reflect the configured limit as telemetry, but the controller does not use those values as its authoritative source. The limit must be addressed at the firmware level (RTL8762C patch at offset `0xF848`).

## Open Questions

The following fields have not been definitively identified and warrant further investigation:

- Byte 5 in Frame A (`0x88`) — constant value, possibly a bitfield for additional flags
- Variable byte 8 in Frame B — confirm whether it correlates with throttle position or power draw
- Bytes 3–4 in Frame C — confirm whether they encode current speed during riding
- Bytes 5–8 in Frame C — confirm battery voltage hypothesis by measuring at various charge levels
- Byte 10 in Frame C — observe during riding to determine if it tracks speed
- Bytes 13–14 in Frame C (`D5 48`) — check for changes after riding distance; may be odometer
